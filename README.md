This project was created to fulfill my curiosity after a shower thought/hypothesis that:

> Moving objects from a stationary video can be erased by simply displaying the most frequently occuring pixel value for each pixel, or in other words, displaying the mode of the pixel value for each pixel.

### Usage

There are 3 implementations, each performing similar tasks but with small differences.

1. black and white with division
2. independent rgb with division
3. dependent rgb with division

- *Independent* : the mode for each channel(RGB) are calculated separately.
- *Depndent* : the mode for each channel(RGB) are dependent to each other.

### Specifics
